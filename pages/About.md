Mirage is a blogging 'engine' that compiles Markdown files into static HTML files in a blog structure, and optionally pushes the resulting site to S3.

This can result in drastically lower running costs and maintenance overhead compared to running, e.g., Wordpress for a small, simple blog.

Mirage was built by Tom White.
