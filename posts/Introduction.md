Welcome to the Mirage blogging engine. To write posts or pages, just create new Markdown files in the posts or pages folders.

To build the blog, run `./mirage compile`, and to deploy it, make sure you have set up `config.yml` appropriately, then run `./mirage deploy`.

You can recompile live on file changes with `./mirage watch`, which will also run a local server for you.
